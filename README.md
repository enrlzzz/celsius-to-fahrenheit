# Temperature Converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)

This repository contains a simple Java program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The application prompts the user for a temperature in Celsius, applies the standard conversion formula ($F = C \times 1.8 + 32$), and then prints the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.

This program is a great starting point for learning how to use user input with the `Scanner` class and perform basic mathematical operations.
